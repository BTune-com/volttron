## Scheduler Example Agent

The Scheduler Example Agent demonstrates how to use the scheduling feature of the Actuator Agent
as well as how to send a command. This agent publishes a request for a reservation on a (fake) 
device then takes an action when itâ€™s scheduled time appears. 

The ActuatorAgent must be running first to exercise this example.
